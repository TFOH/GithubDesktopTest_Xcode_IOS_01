# GithubDesktopTest_Xcode_IOS_01

Wow my first project push

This is the first comment in the read me, I created a new xcode project on my computer in the sites folder, and made sure 
that 'create a github repositiory on my mac' was checked before creating the project. 

Then I went to github desktop app and clicked the '+' Icon in the top left corner and chose 'Add'

I then navigated to the local folder where i had saved the new Xcode project and chose add.

At this point the new project folder appeared in the 'other' section of the REPOSITORIES window (On the left) with the computer icon next to it (I think this means that currently the project is only local)

In order to push this project now to the Github web service, first I need to create a commit message in the bottom left of the project window in Github Desktop.

Next I need to click 'publish' in the top right corner of the desktop App, to push this to the web service.
Select an appropriate name for the project on GitHub, and click 'Publish Repository' -  you will see a loading animation saying 'Pushing to GitHub'

Now go back to the GitHub web service and refresh the 'repositories' page, now we can see our newly pushed project in our repository.

Now we have moved the local repositiory to the web service.

Now we can open the new remote project in Github web service

Now we can click the 'add read me' button on this page and start to make some changes to the file.

Add a couple lines of text and click 'commit new file'. This file is now added to the repository.

If we now want to pull this file back down from the Web service, we go to the desktop app and click the 'Sync' button in the top right corner

We can check out the details of this sync by clicking on the 'History' tab in GitHUb Desktop.

Now this file (and any others that have been added to the online master since pushing the repo to the web service) will be in our LOCAL repository

We can now edit this read.me file locally, and when we look in the 'Uncommited Changes' tab we will see the file's edits shown in the right coloumn next to the file name that's changed in the left column.

We now add a new commit message for these changes we just made

Now click 'commit to master' to add it in to our local repository's master branch

At this point we now click 'sync' in the top right corner of the desktop app to push changes to the remote repository / web service
